# SHAP-Markowitz-ZScore-Explainer
This project addresses the "black-box" problem in automated investment: Uses Random Forest &amp; SHAP to predict/explain Markowitz-optimized portfolio Z-scores, identifying asset influence using Italian stock data. Builds crucial transparency. ⚠️ It is not a financial advisor. Don't use it in real life. NOT financial advice/real-life investment tool.
